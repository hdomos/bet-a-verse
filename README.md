Please write a basic sport betting platform using the TALL stack with an Administration and a Public part.
It works by having games with 2 teams, and you can vote for one of the teams.

### Administration Part:

• Login
• Create/Edit/Delete a Game (Name, Team1, Team2)
• Start Game (sets game active)
• Stop Game (sets game inactive)

### Public Part:

• Display all active games
• Render a public Game-Detail-Page (if it is active)
• The Visitor can vote for one Team, and the votes are stored in the DB

If you want and have time, there can be some upgrades:

• First of all, that the votes and results of the games should also be displayed in the admin-part
• Use as much Livewire as possible
• For everything else, surpise us :)
